# SBhelper
A simple program helps to deal with the final project of "digital design" course of Tongji. (written in Jan. 2015)

Need not to read the following if you have no idea what I'm talking about!

Mainly using the api of autodesk inventor to do some data-modifying work.

Write for fun but it does far more help than expected.

#How to use
1.Run Autodesk Inventor.

2.Open your StreetBlock inventor files.

3.Run the "SB helper.exe".

#Functions
1.Say Goodbye to Parameters: add userparameters and modify modelparameter names.

2.add rFloorArea rFootArea : add these two parameters and their expressions.

3.del ":1" : delete the ":1" in assembly parts name.

4.Unground: unground parts except the "Ground" part.
